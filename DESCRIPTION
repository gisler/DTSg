Description: Basic time series functionalities such as listing of missing
    values, application of arbitrary aggregation as well as rolling window
    functions and automatic detection of periodicity. As it is mainly based on
    'data.table', it is fast and - in combination with the 'R6' package - offers
    reference semantics. In addition to its native R6 interface, it provides an
    S3 interface inclusive an S3 wrapper method generator for those who prefer
    the latter.
