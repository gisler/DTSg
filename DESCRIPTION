Title: A Class for Working with Time Series Based on 'data.table' and 'R6' with
    Largely Optional Reference Semantics
Version: 0.7.1.9000

Description: Basic time series functionalities such as listing of missing
    values, application of arbitrary aggregation as well as rolling (asymmetric)
    window functions and automatic detection of periodicity. As it is mainly
    based on 'data.table', it is fast and - in combination with the 'R6'
    package - offers reference semantics. In addition to its native R6
    interface, it provides an S3 interface inclusive an S3 wrapper method 
    generator for those who prefer the latter. Finally yet importantly, its
    functional approach allows incorporating functionalities from many other
    packages.
