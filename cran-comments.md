## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed `\dontrun{}` in the examples and instead made sure functions requiring suggested packages are only exectuted if these packages are installed.
* Did the latter for tests and vignettes as well.

## Test Environments

* local Windows (R 3.5.2)
* Linux on Travis CI (R 3.5.2)
* OS X on Travis CI (R 3.5.2)
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD Check Results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream Dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
