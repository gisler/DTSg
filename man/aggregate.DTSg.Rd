\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link{DTSg}} object (S3 method only).}

\item{funby}{One of the temporal aggregation level functions described in
\code{\link{TALFs}} or a user defined temporal aggregation level function. See
corresponding section for further information.}

\item{fun}{A summary function, (named) \code{\link{list}} of summary functions or
(named) character vector specifying summary functions applied column-wise
to all the values of the same temporal aggregation level. The return
value(s) must be of length one. See corresponding section for further
information.}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments passed on to \code{fun}.}

\item{cols}{A character vector specifying the columns to aggregate. Another
possibility is a character string containing either comma separated column
names, for example, \code{"x,y,z"}, or the start and end column separated by a
colon, for example, \code{"x:z"}.}

\item{n}{A logical specifying if a column named \code{.n} giving the number of
values per temporal aggregation level shall be added. See corresponding
section for further information.}

\item{ignoreDST}{A logical specifying if day saving time shall be ignored
by \code{funby}. See corresponding section for further information.}

\item{multiplier}{A positive integerish value \dQuote{multiplying} the
temporal aggregation level of certain \code{\link{TALFs}}. See corresponding section
for further information.}

\item{funbyHelpers}{An optional \code{\link{list}} with helper data passed on to
\code{funby}. See corresponding section for further information.}

\item{funbyApproach}{A character string specifying the flavour of the applied
temporal aggregation level function. Either \code{"base"}, which utilises
\code{\link{as.POSIXct}}, or \code{"fasttime"}, which utilises \code{\link[fasttime:fastPOSIXct]{fasttime::fastPOSIXct}},
or \code{"RcppCCTZ"}, which utilises \code{\link[RcppCCTZ:parseDatetime]{RcppCCTZ::parseDatetime}} as the main
function for transforming timestamps.}

\item{clone}{A logical specifying if the object shall be modified in place or
if a deep clone (copy) shall be made beforehand.}

\value{
Returns an aggregated \code{\link{DTSg}} object.

\description{
Applies a temporal aggregation level function to the \emph{.dateTime} column of a
\code{\link{DTSg}} object and aggregates its values column-wise to the function's
temporal aggregation level utilising one or more provided summary functions.
Additionally, it sets the object's \code{\link[=DTSg]{aggregated}} field to \code{TRUE}.
}
\section{User defined TALFs, TALFs helper data and multiplier}{

User defined temporal aggregation level functions have to return a
\code{\link{POSIXct}} vector of the same length as the time series and accept two
arguments: a \code{\link{POSIXct}} vector as its first and a \code{\link{list}} with helper data
as its second. The default elements of this \code{\link{list}} are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \emph{timezone:} Same as the \code{\link[=DTSg]{timezone}} field.
\item \emph{ignoreDST:} Same as the \code{ignoreDST} argument.
\item \emph{periodicity:} Same as the \code{\link[=DTSg]{periodicity}} field.
\item \emph{na.status:} Same as the \code{\link[=DTSg]{na.status}} field.
\item \emph{multiplier:} Same as the \code{multiplier} argument.
\item \emph{funbyApproach:} Same as the \code{funbyApproach} argument.
}

Any additional element specified in the \code{funbyHelpers} argument is appended
to the end of the default \code{\link{list}}. In case \code{funbyHelpers} contains an
\emph{ignoreDST, multiplier} or \emph{funbyApproach} element, it takes precedence over
the respective method argument. \emph{timezone, periodicity} and \emph{na.status}
elements are rejected, as they are always taken directly from the object.

The temporal aggregation level of certain \code{\link{TALFs}} can be adjusted with the
help of the \code{multiplier} argument. A \code{multiplier} of \code{10}, for example, makes
\code{\link{byY_____}} aggregate to decades instead of years. Another example
is a \code{multiplier} of \code{6} provided to \code{\link{by_m____}}. The function
then aggregates all months of all first and all months of all second half
years instead of all months of all years separately. This feature is
supported by the following \code{\link{TALFs}} of the package:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{byY_____}}
\item \code{\link{byYm____}}
\item \code{\link{byYmdH__}} (UTC and equivalent as well as all Etc/GMT time zones only)
\item \code{\link{byYmdHM_}}
\item \code{\link{byYmdHMS}}
\item \code{\link{by_m____}}
\item \code{\link{by___H__}} (UTC and equivalent as well as all Etc/GMT time zones only)
\item \code{\link{by____M_}}
\item \code{\link{by_____S}}
}
}

\section{Summary functions}{

Some examples for \code{fun} are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{mean}}
\item \code{\link{list}(min = \link{min}, max = \link{max})}
\item \code{c(sd = "sd", var = "var")}
}

A \code{\link{list}} or character vector must have names in case more than one summary
function is provided. The method can benefit from \pkg{data.table}'s
\emph{\link[data.table:datatable-optimize]{GForce}} optimisation in case a character
vector specifying summary functions is provided.
}

\section{Number of values per temporal aggregation level}{

Depending on the number of columns to aggregate, the \code{.n} column contains
different counts:
\itemize{
\item One column: The counts are calculated from the columns' values disregarding
any missing values.
\item More than one column: The counts are calculated from the \emph{.dateTime} column
including all missing values.
}
}

\section{Ignore day saving time}{

\code{ignoreDST} tells a temporal aggregation level function if it is supposed to
ignore day saving time while transforming the timestamps. This can be a
desired feature for time series strictly following the position of the sun
such as hydrological time series. Doing so ensures that diurnal variations
are preserved by all means and all intervals are of the \dQuote{correct}
length, however, a possible limitation might be that the day saving time
shift is invariably assumed to be one hour long. This feature requires that
the periodicity of the time series has been recognised and is supported by
the following \code{\link{TALFs}} of the package:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{byY_____}}
\item \code{\link{byYQ____}}
\item \code{\link{byYm____}}
\item \code{\link{byYmd___}}
\item \code{\link{by_Q____}}
\item \code{\link{by_m____}}
\item \code{\link{by___H__}}
}
}
